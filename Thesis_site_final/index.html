                    <h3>manifesto</h3>
<p id="manifesto"> The role of a designer has constantly changed over time but has always coexisted with progress and but not always with technology. By examining the role of designers through time we can draw a conclusion on the impact that current designers partake in our everyday lives compared to the introduction of modernism and postmodernism that followed in the 19th century.

Design has always existed even dating back to early colonialism in the 1500s where era of piracy was common and lasted until late 17th century. Common ornamentation and attire subsequently created one of the earliest brands. The iconic black flag with skulls crossed, combined with the boats dark sails created distinguished identities that were recognized within the Caribbean. Designer pirates doesn’t sound right, but by following style guides they created a fearsome brand. I would acknowledge I am not the first to recognize pirates as designers, nor their connections to establishing some of the earliest visual identities. It is a supported idea through designers, an analogous identity would be christianity and the cross. The reasoning behind the introduction of pirates or christianity is not for their use of visual communication but to discuss the technology that existed. Shifting the focus from the pirates identity to the tools that made it possible and the impact:
“In 1680, English pirate Bartholomew Sharpe and 300 men crossed the Central American isthmus at Panama, captured a Spanish ship, the Trinity, and used it to raid Spanish vessels up and down the Pacific coast of Central and South America….the most valuable treasures they seized was not gold or silver, but an atlas of Spanish sailing charts. Sharpe later commissioned a colorfully illustrated English copy of the stolen atlas and presented it to the king of England—a gift that likely saved his freedom, if not his life.” 
The maps stolen by Sharpe exposed Spanish trade routes and navigation routes that the English then used to ambush and steal commodities. These maps were a main source of storage for large invaluable information that pirates sought after but also used extensively in the sea. Without maps sailing would not be possible, without navigation, trade would be impossible across continents. The significance of maps and the precision of understanding the globe as a sphere has thus received multiple improvements. These points objectively suggest maps at this point to be an interface because the strong importance within the role of the economy but advancements in exploration. Maps extended beyond paper and lines, they contained information that could inevitably control someone’s life or influence decisions, augmenting reality for map holders by instilling confidence from within the information presented. Maps are pivotal as they brought about global trading ultimately resulting in mass production in conjunction with global economy, granting the possibility of the Industrial Revolution to even exist. 

Understanding the map as an interface helps to introduce further discussion on the transformation of design throughout time in the lense of present technology. These maps impact represents insight into how future technology affects society. The definition of an interface will be further developed throughout this text and reshaped as the role of the designer is explored.  Only by traveling back we are able to contrast past interfaces to our own present conditions and observe the influence that brings us modernism and postmodernism. Maps are not the only interfaces that exist but they are excellent examples of utilitarian, and quality multi-purpose tools. This idea of functionality and aesthetic will be traced through interfaces and objects from the early 20th century to our Modern Age.

The first example of examining the role the designer holds can be observed through the book as an interface. Following designers Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser whom founded Wiener Werkstatte (1903–1932) their principles can influence the outlook of what a book can represent and mean. Engaged in producing “hand-crafted furnishings, decorative objects, textiles, jewelry, and bookbindings.” They went as far as to consider creating “an inner relationship linking public, designer, and worker...Our guiding principle is function, utility our first condition, and our strength must lie in good proportions.” The designer when introduced is to create functional and intentional pieces of work while maining order and balance. They present the challenge of ‘current’ printing as “The art of good binding has completely died out. Hollow backs, wire sewing, carelessly-cut, loosely-bound leaves and poor quality have become ineradicable.” The importance lies within the poor quality unable to be tamed, the amount of bad design taking over. This signifies a relationship being developed early on in the 1900s to the production of books and whom create them. Since the first publication of the Gutenberg bible roughly around the 1500s the decay of importance in relationship to craft heavily declined. The book as a source of information and demand created an absence in the role design maintains quality. Book as a commodity growing into more wide spread an normalized the value degrades in craftsmen ship no longer interested in producing books with decoration but readily available. 

Other areas of design deal with this similar removal of decoration, overviewing the design trend we extend to architecture. In relation to architecture Adolf Loos (1870–1933) draws a contrast to this idea in his essay Ornament and Crime:  “The evolution of culture is synonymous with the removal of ornaments from objects of daily use.. What cast the gloom was the thought that ornament could no longer be produced” Loos suggests this continuous evolution of removal is subsequent to the relationship society holds ornament. The architecture with the removal of additional decoration sought only after functionality.  “Those objects without ornament, which mankind had created in earlier centuries, had been carelessly discarded and destroyed.” Loos references past objects, these artifacts that are being destroyed aligns with Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser. The removal of decoration brings about a modern movement but to what extent does it transform the lives of society. 

On the topic of architecture, architect, painter, and designer Theo van Doesburg (1883–1931)  also highlights theories of designers role and insight onto De Stijl and “the new style” that comes from holland around a utopian movement that included notable members such as van Doesburg, the painter Piet Mondrian and Bark van der Leck, also architects Gerrit Rietveld and J. J. P.. In a lecture at Berlin transcribed “The Will to Style” Theo exclaims:
”The needs of our age, both ideal and practical, demand constructive certainty. Only  machine can provide this constructive certainty. The new potentialities of the machine have given rise to an aesthetic theory appropriate to our age, which I have had occasion to call the ‘mechanical aesthetic.. The style we are approaching will be, above all, a style of liberation and vital repose.”
Theo is able to include the new machine and the role machine plays within the design and structure. In short, book has been in process of becoming transitioned by the machine, the new interface now lies in the machine. Subtle, the machine lies within many aspects of the industry and introduce new possibilities of construction as Theo suggests. In contrast to Loss removal of decoration machine brings about the possibility of liberation and a new form of socialism. These views of complete removal of ornamentation can be viewed as a threat to human inclusion and accessibility of design. Furthermore this style into appreciation of the machine grew with sub styles such as streamlining. 

Norman Bel Geddes (1893–1958) is an industrial designer who first laid claim to the idea of mainline streamlining. Bel Geddes produced forms of approaching the future through predictions on improvements in products, transportation and technologies.  Highlighting an excerpt from “Streamlining”.. “Streamlining as a science has not yet really been born. It’s practical development in aeronautics has been highly effective, but not understood. In other fields, both in theory and in practice it is still in embryo.” Norman is notable to his theories behind streamlining which subsequently created a spawn of designs following this form applied to radio’s, cars, and even toasters. Norman makes it apparent the functionality is important to future efficiency and thus investment should be incentivised for gains. 

Harold Van Doren (1895–1957) another industrial design adds into this topic by questioning the designer’s place in industry. In an excerpt from Industrial Design: A Practical Guide Harold goes into exclaiming how design fits within the industry of the machine. 
“A designer with the multiple gifts of artistic ability, mechanical sense, and merchandising wits may become indispensable to his client if these talents are permitted full scope… At his best, the designer is an animator, a builder of enthusiasm in others. He is prodigal of ideas and if one proves too costly or impractical he has another on the tip of his tongue or the point of his pencil. He is resourceful; he is familiar with the standard processes of manufacture and can always see ways of improving a product within the framework of merchandising necessity, present equipment, and reasonable cost.”
Harold Van Doren is an example of the role designers took with the full integration of the machine and no longer use of additional decoration. Now bringing back the idea of the map and interface we can extract the complete transition in the way designers are considered and produce objects. In the world of capitalism from the rise of the global economy the designer is no longer concerned with the relationship between the object and the user but resourceful in the manufacturing process. The designer is no longer as skilled but more developed in the industry, acts as a businessman and negotiator between the client and machine. 

Lastly Edgar Kaufmann, jr., (1910–1989) introduces “What is Modern Design” that can be relative to the modern digital age. American architect and historian, curated and influenced MoMA’s “Good Design” exhibitions of 1950-55. Kaufmann lays out some important principles: 

“Design Is Expressive, Design is this sense related to many other human activities, engineering and art in particular. Politics, economics, philosophy and science affect design and the way we look at it. That is to say, design is a central human activity, interlocked with everything people do. Hence its exceptional capacity to epitomize the character of an age and of the people who create it...Artificial Changes of Style, In contrast to this conservative area of modern design, there exists in commerce an organized procedure to make some things appear ‘out-of-date’ after a season or a year. This may well stimulate trade; but in design it affects only superficial details and is more likely to confuse or distort basica values than to forward them.”

Kaufmann emphasises important aspects of approaching design that is lost overtime with the introduction of the machine. Including the topic of expressive design, Kaufmann is accepting the design role in society and places value as impacts all human activity drawing back to that small relationship of the designer and book. In today’s society with the role of technology it is easy to get lost in what is designed and what is not, the production of mass media and objects creates an overwhelming sensation that draws anxiety into everyone. Phones and computers have created a collective liberation of collaboration as Theo van Doesburg wanted to see but in a way he would disapprove. The amount of technology and innovation has created a new age, the information age in which we are no longer humans but users in a society that businesses feed off of. There no longer exist the Bel Geddes in today’s era, the push for something new is lost in the poor quality Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser eluded to. As the economy grows, designers fit into Harold Van Doren guide of assimilation to the machine and guidance of understanding the process. In a sense design needs to include a more humane approach the interface of the map no longer exists in today’s era, the interaction of the map being an interface, providing invaluable information is replaced by the interface of modern technology. Modern interfaces now control the ideas and actions of human activity, platforms such as facebook are subject to misleading people in political and social topics. The age of mass information creates an isolation of skill, and drawback of the designers role which is now engineers, and programmers. Designers must reclaim the relationship created by interacting with an interface or architecture in a humane aspect, considering the workers conditions, the materials, and process. Eliminate the  Design should fulfill the needs of modern life but not to withhold future advancements in science or progression for the consumption of products.
